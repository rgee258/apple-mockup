This repository contains a mockup of the Apple homepage back in 2014.

This mockup was created to experience the capabilities of gradients using CSS, as well as some of the nuances that lie in using CSS backgrounds.

Check it out [here](https://rgee258.github.io/apple-mockup/).

The darkening background color over the navigation bar links was done using an interesting method using box-shadow, the trick can be found as the second answer from this question on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9182978/semi-transparent-color-layer-over-background-image).

If you want to see the original homepage like a time traveler, view it on [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20140301004610/http://www.apple.com/).

This project is done following The Odin Project, which can
